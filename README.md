1. Aug A3 Para XS - The Aug A3 is extremely similar to the M4A1, and sports high damage up close, dealing a three-shot kill (3SK) to the body up to 40 studs. At longer ranges, the damage is quite poor, requiring six shots to kill (6STK) at the end of its damage drop-off.

2. PPSH-41 - The PPSh-41 is an extremely low damage-per-bullet weapon. At any range before 19 meters, the PPSh-41 will deal a mere 22 damage, warranting five shots to kill, or four shots, if two bullets are headshots.

3. Honey Badger - The Honey Badger is an integrally-suppressed weapon at stock and has a base damage of 34 at close range and 22 at range.

4. HK416 - The HK416 is average for its class. Although it has a four-shot kill (4SK) up close and a 5SK at the end of its damage drop-off, its damage values are high enough that one headshot will reduce the shots to kill (STK) requirements by one at any range.
